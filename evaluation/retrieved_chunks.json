With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe\nabout their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire\nover matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do\nthe same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources\nof human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life\nupon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of\nthe mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men\nfancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to\nthemselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the\ngulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the\nbeasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,\nregarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their\nplans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great\ndisillusionment.\nThe planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the\nsun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it\nreceives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It\nmust be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world;\nand long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface\nmust have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of\nthe volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the\ntemperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all\nthat is necessary for the support of animated existence.\nYet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to\nthe very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that\nintelligent life might have developed there fa",

That’s good.”\n“But it’s something more than a meteorite. It’s a cylinder—an\nartificial cylinder, man! And there’s something inside.”\nHenderson stood up with his spade in his hand.\n“What’s that?” he said. He was deaf in one ear.\nOgilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson was a minute or so\ntaking it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and\ncame out into the road. The two men hurried back at once to the common,\nand found the cylinder still lying in the same position. But now the\nsounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed\nbetween the top and the body of the cylinder. Air was either entering\nor escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound.\nThey listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,\nmeeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside\nmust be insensible or dead.\nOf course the two were quite unable to do anything. They shouted\nconsolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get\nhelp. One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and disordered,\nrunning up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop\nfolks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their\nbedroom windows. Henderson went into the railway station at once, in\norder to telegraph the news to London. The newspaper articles had\nprepared men’s minds for the reception of the idea.\nBy eight o’clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already\nstarted for the common to see the “dead men from Mars.” That was the\nform the story took. I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a\nquarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_. I was\nnaturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the\nOttershaw bridge to the sand-pits.\n\nIII.\nON HORSELL COMMON.\nI found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge\nhole in whic",

He was so fascinated by this and\nby the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for\nanything seaward. And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had\nsuddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from\nthe seat upon which he was standing. There was a shouting all about\nhim, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered\nfaintly. The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands.\nHe sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards\nfrom their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a\nplough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge\nwaves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles\nhelplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the\nwaterline.\nA douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment. When his eyes were\nclear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big\niron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure, and from that twin\n\nfunnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the\ntorpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong, coming to the rescue\nof the threatened shipping.\nKeeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks, my\nbrother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again, and\nhe saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far out to\nsea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged. Thus\nsunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less\nformidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was\npitching so helplessly. It would seem they were regarding this new\nantagonist with astonishment. To their intelligence, it may be, the\ngiant was ev",

It was probably her not\nfiring that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did. They did\nnot know what to make of her. One shell, and they would have sent her\nto the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray.\nShe was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway\nbetween the steamboat and the Martians—a diminishing black bulk against\nthe receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast.\nSuddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a\ncanister of the black gas at the ironclad. It hit her larboard side and\nglanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding\ntorrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear. To the\nwatchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in their\neyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians.\nThey saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as\nthey retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like\ngenerator of the Heat-Ray. He held it pointing obliquely downward, and\na bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch. It must have driven\nthrough the iron of the ship’s side like a white-hot iron rod through\npaper.\nA flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the\nMartian reeled and staggered. In another moment he was cut down, and a\ngreat body of water and steam shot high in the air. The guns of the\n_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the\nother, and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer,\nricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a\nsmack to matchwood.\nBut no one heeded that very much. At the sight of the Martian’s\ncollapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the\ncrowding passengers on the steamer’s stern shouted together. And then\nthey yelled again. For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove\nsomething long and black, the flames",

She headed straight for a second Martian, and was\nwithin a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear. Then with\na violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped\nupward. The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and\nin another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the\nimpetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of\ncardboard. My brother shouted involuntarily. A boiling tumult of steam\nhid everything again.\n“Two!” yelled the captain.\nEveryone was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with\n\nfrantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the\ncrowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea.\nThe steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third\nMartian and the coast altogether. And all this time the boat was\npaddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last\nthe confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,\nand nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the\nthird Martian be seen. But the ironclads to seaward were now quite\nclose and standing in towards shore past the steamboat.\nThe little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads\nreceded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled\nbank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and combining in\nthe strangest way. The fleet of refugees was scattering to the\nnortheast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the\nsteamboat. After a time, and before they reached the sinking cloud\nbank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went about and\npassed into the thickening haze of evening southward.

Everyone struggled to the\nrail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west,\nbut nothing was to be distinguished clearly. A mass of smoke rose\nslanting and barred the face of the sun. The steamboat throbbed on its\nway through an interminable suspense.\nThe sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the\nevening star trembled into sight.

There I will\nresume. We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day—the day\nof the panic—in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black Smoke\nfrom the rest of the world.

I grew very weary and\nirritable with the curate’s perpetual ejaculations; I tired of the\nsight of his selfish despair. After some ineffectual remonstrance I\nkept away from him, staying in a room—evidently a children’s\nschoolroom—containing globes, forms, and copybooks. When he followed me\nthither, I went to a box room at the top of the house and, in order to\nbe alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in.\nWe were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and the\nmorning of the next. There were signs of people in the next house on\nSunday evening—a face at a window and moving lights, and later the\nslamming of a door. But I do not know who these people were, nor what\nbecame of them. We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke\ndrifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer\nand nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house\nthat hid us.\nA Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a\njet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the\nwindows it touched, and scalded the curate’s hand as he fled out of the\nfront room. When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked\nout again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had\npassed over it. Looking towards the river, we were astonished to see an\nunaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows.\nFor a time we did not see how this change affected our position, save\nthat we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke. But later I\nperceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get away.\nSo soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream of\naction returned.

When it was clear to him that I meant to\ngo alone—had reconciled myself to going alone—he suddenly roused\nhimself to come. And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we\nstarted about five o’clock, as I should judge, along the blackened road\nto Sunbury.\nIn Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in\ncontorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and\nluggage, all covered thickly with black dust. That pall of cindery\npowder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii.\nWe got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of strange\nand unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were relieved\nto find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift. We\nwent through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro under the\nchestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards\nHampton, and so we came to Twickenham. These were the first people we\nsaw.\nAway across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still\nafire. Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke, and\nthere were more people about here, though none could give us news. For\nthe most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull to\nshift their quarters. I have an impression that many of the houses here\n\nwere still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even for\nflight. Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the\nroad. I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, pounded\ninto the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond\nBridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, of\ncourse, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses,\nsome many feet across.

Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once\nbeen smoke, and dead bodies—a heap near the approach to the station;\nbut we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards\nBarnes.\nWe saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a\nside street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed deserted. Up the\nhill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the town of Richmond\nthere was no trace of the Black Smoke.\nThen suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people running,\nand the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over\nthe housetops, not a hundred yards away from us. We stood aghast at our\ndanger, and had the Martian looked down we must immediately have\nperished. We were so terrified that we dared not go on, but turned\naside and hid in a shed in a garden. There the curate crouched, weeping\nsilently, and refusing to stir again.\nBut my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest, and in\nthe twilight I ventured out again. I went through a shrubbery, and\nalong a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds, and so\nemerged upon the road towards Kew. The curate I left in the shed, but\nhe came hurrying after me.\nThat second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did. For it was\nmanifest the Martians were about us. No sooner had the curate overtaken\nme than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or\nanother, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge.\nFour or five little black figures hurried before it across the\ngreen-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian\npursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran\nradiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to\ndestroy them, but picked them up one by one.

In one place we blundered upon a scorched\nand blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered\ndead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with\ntheir legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty feet,\nperhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages.\nSheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent and\ndeserted. Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too dark\nfor us to see into the side roads of the place. In Sheen my companion\nsuddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one\n\nof the houses.\nThe first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the window,\nwas a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in\nthe place but some mouldy cheese. There was, however, water to drink;\nand I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our next\nhouse-breaking.\nWe then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake. Here\nthere stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the pantry of\nthis domicile we found a store of food—two loaves of bread in a pan, an\nuncooked steak, and the half of a ham. I give this catalogue so\nprecisely because, as it happened, we were destined to subsist upon\nthis store for the next fortnight. Bottled beer stood under a shelf,\nand there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces. This\npantr",

The\ncurate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly enough, for\npushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when\nthe thing happened that was to imprison us.\n“It can’t be midnight yet,” I said, and then came a blinding glare of\nvivid green light. Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly\nvisible in green and black, and vanished again. And then followed such\na concussion as I have never heard before or since. So close on the\nheels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash\nof glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the\nplaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of\nfragments upon our heads. I was knocked headlong across the floor\nagainst the oven handle and stunned. I was insensible for a long time,\nthe curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness again, and\nhe, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from a cut\nforehead, was dabbing water over me.\nFor some time I could not recollect what had happened. Then things came\nto me slowly. A bruise on my temple asserted itself.\n“Are you better?” asked the curate in a whisper.\nAt last I answered him. I sat up.\n“Don’t move,” he said. “The floor is covered with smashed crockery from\nthe dresser. You can’t possibly move without making a noise, and I\nfancy _they_ are outside.”\nWe both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other\nbreathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us,\nsome plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound.\nOutside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle.\n“That!” said the curate, when presently it ha",

And then the light\nfiltered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through\na triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the\nwall behind us. The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the\nfirst time.\nThe window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which flowed\nover the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet.\nOutside, the soil was banked high against the house. At the top of the\nwindow frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe. The floor was littered\nwith smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was\nbroken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was evident the\ngreater part of the house had collapsed. Contrasting vividly with this\nruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green, and with\na number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating\nblue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering\nfrom the walls above the kitchen range.\nAs the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the body\nof a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still glowing\ncylinder. At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible\nout of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery.\nAbruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind.\n“The fifth cylinder,” I whispered, “the fifth shot from Mars, has\nstruck this house and buried us under the ruins!”\nFor a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:\n“God have mercy upon us!”\nI heard him presently whimpering to himself.\nSave for",

Henderson and Ogilvy were not there.\nI think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and\nhad gone away to breakfast at Henderson’s house.\nThere were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their\nfeet dangling, and amusing themselves—until I stopped them—by throwing\nstones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they\nbegan playing at “touch” in and out of the group of bystanders.\nAmong these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed\nsometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little\nboy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to\nhang about the railway station. There was very little talking. Few of\nthe common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical\nideas in those days. Most of them were staring quietly at the big table\nlike end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had\nleft it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses\nwas disappointed at this inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was\nthere, and other people came. I clambered into the pit and fancied I\nheard a faint movement under my feet. The top had certainly ceased to\nrotate.\nIt was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this\nobject was at all evident to me. At the first glance it was really no\nmore exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the\nroad. Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It\nrequired a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the\ngrey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white\nmetal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an\nunfamiliar hue. “Extra-terrestrial” had no meaning for most of the\nonlookers",

I\ngripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we\ncrouched motionless. Then I turned to see how much of our rampart\nremained. The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open\nin the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was\nable to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet\nsuburban roadway. Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld.\nThe fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house\nwe had first visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed,\npulverised, and dispersed by the blow. The cylinder lay now far beneath\nthe original foundations—deep in a hole, already vastly larger than the\npit I had looked into at Woking. The earth all round it had splashed\nunder that tremendous impact—“splashed” is the only word—and lay in\nheaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses. It had behaved\nexactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer. Our house had\ncollapsed backward; the front portion, even on the ground floor, had\nbeen destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had\nescaped, and stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in by tons\nof earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspect we\nhung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the Martians were\nengaged in making. The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind\nus, and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil\nacross our peephole.\nThe cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on the\nfarther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery,\none of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its occupant, stood\nstiff and",

At first I scarcely noticed the\npit and the cylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them\nfirst, on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy\nin the excavation, and on account of the strange creatures that were\ncrawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it.\nThe mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first. It was one\nof those complicated fabrics that have since been called\nhandling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an\nenormous impetus to terrestrial invention. As it dawned upon me first,\nit presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs,\nand with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars, and reaching\nand clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were\nretracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of\nrods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently\nstrengthened the walls of the cylinder. These, as it extracted them,\nwere lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it.\n\nIts motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did not\nsee it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The\nfighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary\npitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen\nthese structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or\nthe imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,\nscarcely realise that living quality.\nI recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to\ngive a consecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a\nhasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledge\nended. He presented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without either\nflexibility or subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony of\neffect.

To my mind, the\npamphlet would have been much better without them.\nAt first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine,\nbut as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the\ncontrolling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements\nseeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab’s cerebral portion. But\nthen I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leathery\nintegument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the true\nnature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me. With that realisation\nmy interest shifted to those other creatures, the real Martians.\nAlready I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nausea\nno longer obscured my observation. Moreover, I was concealed and\nmotionless, and under no urgency of action.\nThey were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to\nconceive. They were huge round bodies—or, rather, heads—about four feet\nin diameter, each body having in front of it a face. This face had no\nnostrils—indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of\nsmell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just\nbeneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In the back of this head or body—I\nscarcely know how to speak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface,\nsince known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost\nuseless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteen\nslender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eight\neach. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that\ndistinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_. Even as I saw\nthese Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to\nraise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increased\nweight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible.

The greater part of the structure was the\nbrain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles.\nBesides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the\nheart and its vessels. The pulmonary distress caused by the denser\natmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in\nthe convulsive movements of the outer skin.\nAnd this was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a\nhuman being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes up the\nbulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians. They were\nheads—merely heads. Entrails they had none. They did not eat, much less\ndigest. Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other creatures,\nand _injected_ it into their own veins. I have myself seen this being\ndone, as I shall mention in its place. But, squeamish as I may seem, I\n\ncannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even to\ncontinue watching. Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from a still\nliving animal, in most cases from a human being, was run directly by\nmeans of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . .\nThe bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the\nsame time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous\nhabits would seem to an intelligent rabbit.\nThe physiological advantages of the practice of injection are\nundeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and\nenergy occasioned by eating and the digestive process. Our bodies are\nhalf made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning\nheterogeneous food into blood. The digestive processes and their\nreaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds.\nMen go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers, or\nsound gastric glands.

These creatures, to judge\nfrom the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands, were\nbipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the\nsilicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet high\nand having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets. Two or\nthree of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and all were\nkilled before earth was reached. It was just as well for them, for the\nmere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every\nbone in their bodies.\nAnd while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place\ncertain further details which, although they were not all evident to us\nat the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to\nform a clearer picture of these offensive creatures.\nIn three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours.\nTheir organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man sleeps.\nSince they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate, that\nperiodical extinction was unknown to them. They had little or no sense\nof fatigue, it would seem. On earth they could never have moved without\neffort, yet even to the last they kept in action.

Among the lower animals, up even to those first\ncousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processes\noccur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded its\ncompetitor altogether. On Mars, however, just the reverse has\napparently been the case.\nIt is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of\nquasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did\nforecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian\n\ncondition. His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or December,\n1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_, and I\nrecall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called _Punch_.\nHe pointed out—writing in a foolish, facetious tone—that the perfection\nof mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the\nperfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as hair,\nexternal nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential parts of\nthe human being, and that the tendency of natural selection would lie\nin the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages.\nThe brain alone remained a cardinal necessity. Only one other part of\nthe body had a strong case for survival, and that was the hand,\n“teacher and agent of the brain.” While the rest of the body dwindled,\nthe hands would grow larger.\nThere is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians we\nhave beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of\nthe animal side of the organism by the intelligence. To me it is quite\ncredible that the Martians may be descended from beings not unlike\nourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter\ngiving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the\nexpense of the rest of the body. Without the body the brain would, of\ncourse, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any of the\nemotional s",

A hundred diseases, all the fevers and contagions of\nhuman life, consumption, cancers, tumours and such morbidities, never\nenter the scheme of their life. And speaking of the differences between\nthe life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may allude here to the curious\nsuggestions of the red weed.\nApparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a\ndominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds\nwhich the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them\ngave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths. Only that known\npopularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition\nwith terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory growth,\nand few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, the red weed\ngrew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides of\nthe pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its\ncactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our\ntriangular window. And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the\ncountry, and especially wherever there was a stream of water.\nThe Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single\nround drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range\nnot very different from ours except that, according to Philips, blue\nand violet were as black to them. It is commonly supposed that they\ncommunicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted,\nfor instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written\nevidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions) to which I\nhave already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief source of\n",

And I have\nbeen convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions. Before the\nMartian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may remember, I\nhad written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory.\nThe Martians wore no clothing. Their conceptions of ornament and\ndecorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they\nevidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, but\nchanges of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all\nseriously.

And not\nonly did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), or\nabstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little use\nis made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circular\nmotions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of the\nmachinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over\nsmall but beautifully curved friction bearings.

I turned to a scowling face,\nand silent, eloquent lips.

Except\nfor the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of\nwhite moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for the clinking\nof the handling-machine, quite still. That night was a beautiful\nserenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the sky to\nherself. I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was that\nmade me listen. Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like\nthe sound of great guns. Six distinct reports I counted, and after a\nlong interval six again. And that was all.\nIV.\nTHE DEATH OF THE CURATE.\nIt was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the last\ntime, and presently found myself alone. Instead of keeping close to me\nand trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone back into the\n\nscullery. I was struck by a sudden thought. I went back quickly and\nquietly into the scullery. In the darkness I heard the curate drinking.\nI snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy.\nFor a few minutes there was a tussle. The bottle struck the floor and\nbroke, and I desisted and rose. We stood panting and threatening each\nother. In the end I pl",

I would not let him eat\nany more that day. In the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at\nthe food. I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake. All day and\nall night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and he weeping and\ncomplaining of his immediate hunger. It was, I know, a night and a day,\nbut to me it seemed—it seems now—an interminable length of time.\nAnd so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict. For\ntwo vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests. There\nwere times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I cajoled and\npersuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last bottle of\nburgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could get water.\nBut neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason. He\nwould neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy\nbabbling to himself. The rudimentary precautions to keep our\nimprisonment endurable he would not observe. Slowly I began to realise\nthe complete overthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that my sole\ncompanion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane.\nFrom certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind wandered\nat times. I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept. It sounds\nparadoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity\nof the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane man.\nOn the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and\nnothing I could do would moderate his speech.\n“It is just, O God!” he would say, over and over again. “It is just. On\nme and mine be the punishment laid. We have sinned, we have fallen\nshort. There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust,\nand I held my peace.

The word of the Lord is upon me!”\nIn three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen.\n“I must bear my witness! I go!

One of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris; another\nlimb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams. I stood\npetrified, staring. Then I saw through a sort of glass plate near the\nedge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large dark eyes\nof a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came\nfeeling slowly through the hole.\nI turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the\nscullery door.

For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful advance.\nThen, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the scullery. I\ntrembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright. I opened the door\nof the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness staring at the\nfaintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening. Had the Martian\nseen me?

Then a\nheavy body—I knew too well what—was dragged across the floor of the\nkitchen towards the opening. Irresistibly attracted, I crept to the\ndoor and peeped into the kitchen. In the triangle of bright outer\nsunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,\nscrutinizing the curate’s head. I thought at once that it would infer\nmy presence from the mark of the blow I had given him.\nI crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover\nmyself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the\ndarkness, among the firewood a",

It passed, scraping faintly across the cellar door.\nAn age of almost intolerable suspense intervened; then I heard it\nfumbling at the latch! It had found the door!

I whispered passionate prayers for\nsafety.\nThen I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again.\nSlowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping\nthe furniture.\nWhile I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar door\nand closed it.

He was standing on the cylinder, which was\nnow evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with\nperspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him.\nA large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower\nend was still embedded.

He told me that a faint stirring was\noccasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had\nfailed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The case\nappeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the faint\nsounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior.\nI was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the privileged\nspectators within the contemplated enclosure.

But the pantry was empty; every\nscrap of food had gone. Apparently, the Martian had taken it all on the\nprevious day. At that discovery I despaired for the first time. I took\nno food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day.\nAt first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed\nsensibly. I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of\ndespondent wretchedness. My mind ran on eating. I thought I had become\ndeaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear from the\npit had ceased absolutely. I did not feel strong enough to crawl\nnoiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there.\nOn the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance of\nalarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that\nstood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and\ntainted rain water. I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened by\nthe fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping.\nDuring these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much of\nthe curate and of the manner of his death.\n\nOn the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and thought\ndisjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape.\nWhenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death of the\ncurate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a keen\npain that urged me to drink again and again. The light that came into\nthe scullery was no longer grey, but red.

At the scent of me he barked shortly.\nI thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I should\nbe able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it would be\nadvisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted the attention of the\nMartians.\nI crept forward, saying “Good dog!” very softly; but he suddenly\nwithdrew his head and disappeared.\nI listened—I was not deaf—but certainly the pit was still.

With us it would be as with them, to\nlurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed\naway.\nBut so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my\ndominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast. In the\ndirection away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch\nof garden ground unburied. This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,\nand sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed. The density of the weed gave\nme a reassuring sense of hiding. The wall was some six feet high, and\nwhen I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my feet to the\ncrest. So I went along by the side of it, and came to a corner and a\nrockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble into the garden\nI coveted.

These fragments of nourishment served\n\nonly to whet my hunger. At first I was surprised at this flood in a\nhot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the\ntropical exuberance of the red weed.

As the\nwater spread the weed followed them, until the ruined villas of the\nThames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp, whose margin I\nexplored, and much of the desolation the Martians had caused was\nconcealed.\nIn the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread. A\ncankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of certain\nbacteria, presently seized upon it. Now by the action of natural\nselection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power\nagainst bacterial diseases—they never succumb without a severe\nstruggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead. The fronds\nbecame bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle. They broke off at the\nleast touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early growth\ncarried their last vestiges out to sea.\nMy first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my\nthirst. I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed\nsome fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly,\nmetallic taste. I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to\nwade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the\nflood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to\nMortlake. I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins\nof its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of this\nspate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came\nout on Putney Common.\nHere the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the\nwreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation\nof a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly\nundistu",

The red weed was less abundant; the\ntall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper. I hunted for\nfood among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple of\nsilent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked. I\nrested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in my\nenfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on.\nAll this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians. I\nencountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried\ncircuitously away from the advances I made them. Near Roehampton I had\nseen two human skeletons—not bodies, but skeletons, picked clean—and in\nthe wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats\nand rabbits and the skull of a sheep. But though I gnawed parts of\nthese in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from them.\nAfter sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I\nthink the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason. And in the\ngarden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,\nsufficient to stay my hunger. From this garden one looked down upon\nPutney and the river. The aspect of the place in the dusk was\nsingularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and\ndown the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the\n\nweed. And over all—silence. It filled me with indescribable terror to\nthink how swiftly that desolating change had come.\nFor a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence, and\nthat I stood there alone, the last man left alive. Hard by the top of\nPutney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms dislocated and\nremoved several yards from the rest of the body.

Perhaps even now they were\ndestroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone northward.\nVII.\nTHE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL.\nI spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill,\nsleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to\nLeatherhead. I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into\nthat house—afterwards I found the front door was on the latch—nor how I\nransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of despair, in\nwhat seemed to me to be a servant’s bedroom, I found a rat-gnawed crust\nand two tins of pineapple. The place had been already searched and\nemptied. In the bar I afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches\nthat had been overlooked. The latter I could not eat, they were too\nrotten, but the former not only stayed my hunger, but filled my\npockets. I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating that\npart of London for food in the night. Before I went to bed I had an\ninterval of restlessness, and prowled from window to window, peering\nout for some sign of these monsters. I slept little. As I lay in bed I\nfound myself thinking consecutively—a thing I do not remember to have\ndone since my last argument with the curate. During all the intervening\ntime my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague\nemotional states or a sort of stupid receptivity. But in the night my\nbrain, reinforced, I suppose, by the food I had eaten, grew clear\nagain, and I thought.\nThree things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the\ncurate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of my\nwife. The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; I\nsaw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely disagreeable but\nquite without the quality of remorse. I saw myself then as I see myself\nnow, driven step by step towards that hasty blow, the creature of a\nsequence of accidents leading ",

In the\nsilence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of God that\nsometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial,\nmy only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear. I retraced every step\nof our conversation from the moment when I had found him crouching\nbeside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to the fire and smoke\nthat streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge. We had been incapable of\nco-operation—grim chance had taken no heed of that. Had I foreseen, I\nshould have left him at Halliford. But I did not foresee; and crime is\nto foresee and do. And I set this down as I have set all this story\ndown, as it was. There were no witnesses—all these things I might have\nconcealed. But I set it down, and the reader must form his judgment as\nhe will.\nAnd when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate\nbody, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife. For\n\nthe former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,\nunhappily, I could for the latter. And suddenly that night became\nterrible. I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark. I\nfound myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and\npainlessly struck her out of being. Since the night of my return from\nLeatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,\nhad prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I\nprayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the\ndarkness of God. Strange night! Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn\nhad come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house like a rat\nleaving its hiding place—a creature scarcely larger, an inferior\nanimal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be\nhunted and killed.

In the road that runs from the\ntop of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the\npanic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night\nafter the fighting began. There was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed\nwith the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with a smashed\nwheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled into\nthe now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot of\nblood-stained glass about the overturned water trough. My movements\nwere languid, my plans of the vaguest. I had an idea of going to\nLeatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest chance of\nfinding my wife. Certainly, unless death had overtaken them suddenly,\nmy cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me I might\nfind or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled. I knew I wanted\nto find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the world of men, but\nI had no clear idea how the finding might be done. I was also sharply\naware now of my intense loneliness. From the corner I went, under cover\nof a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of Wimbledon Common,\nstretching wide and far.\nThat dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there\nwas no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the verge\nof the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and vitality. I\ncame upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the\ntrees. I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout\nresolve to live. And presently, turning suddenly, with an odd feeling\nof being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes.\nI stood regarding this. I made a step towards it, and it rose up and\nbecame a man armed with a cutlass. I approached him slowly.

About us neither had gained a footing; laburnums, pink\nmays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of laurels and\nhydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight.

I think I should have stayed by\nhim but for the brutal expression of his face.\nThere was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and it\ngrew thicker in Fulham. The streets were horribly quiet. I got\nfood—sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable—in a baker’s shop here.\nSome way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of powder, and I\npassed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning was\nan absolute relief. Going on towards Brompton, the streets were quiet\nagain.\nHere I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon\ndead bodies. I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the Fulham\nRoad. They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly past\nthem. The black powder covered them over, and softened their outlines.\nOne or two had been disturbed by dogs.\nWhere there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in the\nCity, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds drawn,\nthe desertion, and the stillness.

A\njeweller’s window had been broken open in one place, but apparently the\nthief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains and a watch lay\nscattered on the pavement. I did not trouble to touch them. Farther on\n\nwas a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over\nher knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress, and a smashed\nmagnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement. She seemed\nasleep, but she was dead.\nThe farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the\nstillness. But it was not so much the stillness of death—it was the\nstillness of suspense, of expectation. At any time the destruction that\nhad already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis, and had\nannihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these houses and\nleave them smoking ruins. It was a city condemned and derelict. . . .\nIn South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder.\nIt was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling. It crept\nalmost imperceptibly upon my senses. It was a sobbing alternation of\ntwo notes, “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” keeping on perpetually. When I\npassed streets that ran northward it grew in volume, and houses and\nbuildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again. It came in a full tide\ndown Exhibition Road. I stopped, staring towards Kensington Gardens,\nwondering at this strange, remote wailing. It was as if that mighty\ndesert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude.\n“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” wailed that superhuman note—great waves of\nsound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall\nbuildings on each side. I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the\niron gates of Hyde Park. I had half a mind to break into the Natural\nHistory Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in\norder to see across the park.

At the top,\nnear the park gate, I came upon a strange sight—a bus overturned, and\nthe skeleton of a horse picked clean. I puzzled over this for a time,\nand then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine. The voice grew\nstronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above the housetops\non the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to the northwest.\n“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me,\nfrom the district about Regent’s Park. The desolating cry worked upon\nmy mind. The mood that had sustained me passed. The wailing took\npossession of me. I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and now\nagain hungry and thirsty.\nIt was already past noon. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the\ndead? Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and in its\nblack shroud? I felt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on old friends\nthat I had forgotten for years. I thought of the poisons in the\nchemists’ shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I recalled\nthe two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew, shared the\ncity with myself. . . .\nI came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were black\npowder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the gratings\nof the cellars of some of the houses. I grew very thirsty after the\nheat of my long walk. With infinite trouble I managed to break into a\npublic-house and get food and drink. I was weary after eating, and went\ninto the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horsehair sofa I\nfound there.\nI awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, “Ulla, ulla,\nulla, ulla.” It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some biscuits\nand a cheese in the bar—there was a meat safe, but it contained nothing\nbut maggots—I wandered on through the silent residential squares to\nBaker Street—Portman",

I came upon him as if it were a matter of course. I\nwatched him for some time, but he did not move. He appeared to be\nstanding and yelling, for no reason that I could discover.\nI tried to formulate a plan of action. That perpetual sound of “Ulla,\nulla, ulla, ulla,” confused my mind. Perhaps I was too tired to be very\nfearful. Certainly I was more curious to know the reason of this\nmonotonous crying than afraid. I turned back away from the park and\nstruck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went along under\nthe shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this stationary, howling\nMartian from the direction of St. John’s Wood. A couple of hundred\nyards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a\ndog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong\ntowards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him. He\nmade a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a\nfresh competitor. As the yelping died away down the silent road, the\nwailing sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” reasserted itself.\nI came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John’s Wood\nstation. At first I thought a house had fallen across the road. It was\nonly as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this\nmechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and\ntwisted, among the ruins it had made. The forepart was shattered. It\nseemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been\noverwhelmed in its overthrow. It seemed to me then that this might have\nhappened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its\nMartian.

A little beyond the ruins about the\nsmashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the\nRegent’s Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation.\nAs I crossed the bridge, the sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” ceased.\nIt was, as it were, cut off.

Then suddenly a change, the passing of something—I\nknew not what—and then a stillness that could be felt. Nothing but this\ngaunt quiet.\nLondon about me gazed at me spectrally. The windows in the white houses\nwere like the eye sockets of skulls. About me my imagination found a\nthousand noiseless enemies moving. Terror seized me, a horror of my\ntemerity. In front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was\ntarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway. I could\nnot bring myself to go on. I turned down St. John’s Wood Road, and ran\nheadlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn.

Across the\nChannel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and\nmeat were tearing to our relief. All the shipping in the world seemed\ngoing Londonward in those days. But of all this I have no memory. I\ndrifted—a demented man. I found myself in a house of kindly people, who\nhad found me on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through\nthe streets of St. John’s Wood. They have told me since that I was\nsinging some insane doggerel about “The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!\nThe Last Man Left Alive!” Troubled as they were with their own affairs,\nthese people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude\nto them, I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves\nwith me, sheltered me, and protected me from myself. Apparently they\nhad learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse.\nVery gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me what\nthey had learned of the fate of Leatherhead. Two days after I was\nimprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a Martian.\nHe had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any\nprovocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness\nof power.\nI was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me",

All that time I felt a vague, a growing craving to\nlook once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so\nhappy and bright in my past. It was a mere hopeless desire to feast\nupon my misery. They dissuaded me. They did all they could to divert me\nfrom this morbidity. But at last I could resist the impulse no longer,\nand, promising faithfully to return to them, and parting, as I will\nconfess, from these four-day friends with tears, I went out again into\nthe streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty.\nAlready they were busy with returning people; in places even there were\nshops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water.\nI remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my\nmelancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the\n\nstreets and vivid the moving life about me. So many people were abroad\neverywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed incredible\nthat any great proportion of the population could have been slain. But\nthen I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I met, how\nshaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes, and that\nevery other man still wore his dirty rags. Their faces seemed all with\none of two expressions—a leaping exultation and energy or a grim\nresolution. Save for the expression of the faces, London seemed a city\nof tramps. The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent\nus by the French government. The ribs of the few horses showed\ndismally. Haggard special constables with white badges stood at the\ncorners of every street. I saw little of the mischief wrought by the\nMartians until I reached Wellington Street, and there I saw the red\nweed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo Bridge.\nAt the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts of\nthat grotesque time—a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the",

Most of\nit was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing had\namused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on\nthe back page. The matter he printed was emotional; the news\norganisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing fresh\nexcept that already in one week the examination of the Martian\nmechanisms had yielded astonishing results. Among other things, the\narticle assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the “Secret\nof Flying,” was discovered. At Waterloo I found the free trains that\nwere taking people to their homes. The first rush was already over.\nThere were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for casual\nconversation. I got a compartment to myself, and sat with folded arms,\nlooking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows.\nAnd just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails,\nand on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. To\nClapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the Black\nSmoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham\nJunction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of\nout-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary\nnavvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying.\nAll down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and\nunfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered. Walton, by virtue of\nits unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along the\nline. The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of\nred weed, in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage. The\nSurrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the red\nclimber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain nursery\ngrounds, we",

Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in\nthe morning breeze.

One’s gaze went with infinite relief from the\nscorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green\nsoftness of the eastward hills.\nThe line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing\nrepair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury,\npast the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars,\nand on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in the\nthunderstorm. Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, among a\ntangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened\nbones of the horse scattered and gnawed. For a time I stood regarding\nthese vestiges. . . .\n\nThen I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and\nthere, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found\nburial, and so came home past the College Arms. A man standing at an\nopen cottage door greeted me by name as I passed.\nI looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately.\nThe door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I\napproached.\nIt slammed again. The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open\nwindow from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn. No one\nhad closed it since. The smashed bushes were just as I had left them\nnearly four weeks ago. I stumbled into the hall, and the house felt\nempty. The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had\ncrouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the\ncatastrophe.

That they did not bury any of their dead, and the reckless\nslaughter they perpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance of the\nputrefactive process. But probable as this seems, it is by no means a\nproven conclusion.\nNeither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the Martians\nused with such deadly effect, and the generator of the Heat-Rays\nremains a puzzle. The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South\nKensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further\ninvestigations upon the latter. Spectrum analysis of the black powder\npoints unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a\nbrilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that it\ncombines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly\neffect upon some constituent in the blood. But such unproven\nspeculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to\nwhom this story is addressed. None of the brown scum that drifted down\nthe Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at the\ntime, and now none is forthcoming.\nThe results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the\nprowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have already\ngiven. But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost\ncomplete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and the\ncountless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the\ninterest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific.\nA question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of\nanother attack from the Martians.

Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking\nappeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost\nsimultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was\ndetected upon a photograph of the Martian disk.

But it was scarcely a time\nfor articulate conversation.\n“What ugly _brutes_!” he said. “Good God! What ugly brutes!” He\nrepeated this over and over again.\n“Did you see a man in the pit?” I said; but he made no answer to that.\nWe became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side, deriving,\nI fancy, a certain comfort in one another’s company. Then I shifted my\nposition to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more\nof elevation and when I looked for him presently he was walking towards\nWoking.\nThe sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The\ncrowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard\nnow a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham\ndispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit.\nIt was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I\nsuppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.\nAt any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the\nsand-pits began, a moveme",

I saw a lad\ntrundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of\nthe pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little\nblack knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.\nThis was the Deputation. There had been a hasty consultation, and since\nthe Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,\nintelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by\napproaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent.\nFlutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the left.\nIt was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards I\nlearned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this\nattempt at communication. This little group had in its advance dragged\ninward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete\ncircle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at\ndiscreet distances.\nSuddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous\ngreenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove\nup, one after the other, straight into the still air.\nThis smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so\nbright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown\ncommon towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken\nabruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their\ndispersal.

Its physical condition is still\nlargely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region\nthe midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter.\nIts air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until\nthey cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change\nhuge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically\ninundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to\nus is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the\ninhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened\ntheir intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And\nlooking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we\nhave scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only\n35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own\nwarmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy\natmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting\ncloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow,\nnavy-crowded seas.\nAnd we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at\nleast as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The\nintellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant\nstruggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief\nof the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this\nworld is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they\nregard as inferior animals.

Many think that in some way they are able to\ngenerate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute\nnon-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam\nagainst any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror\nof unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse\nprojects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved these\ndetails. However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the\nessence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light.\nWhatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like\nwater, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon\nwater, incontinently that explodes into steam.\nThat night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit,\ncharred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the common\nfrom Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze.\nThe news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and\nOttershaw about the same time. In Woking the shops had closed when the\ntragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and so forth,\nattracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the Horsell\nBridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon\nthe common. You may imagine the young people brushed up after the\nlabours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would make any\nnovelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial\nflirtation. You may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road\nin the gloaming. . . .\nAs yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had\nopened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the\npost office with a special wire to an evening paper.\nAs these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they found\nlittle knots of peop",

There were\nthree policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their best, under\ninstructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter them from\napproaching the cylinder. There was some booing from those more\nthoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion\nfor noise and horse-play.\n\nStent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision, had\ntelegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians\nemerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange\ncreatures from violence. After that they returned to lead that\nill-fated advance. The description of their death, as it was seen by\nthe crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three\npuffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame.\nBut that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine.

The\nsilent common, the impulse of my flight, the starting flames, were as\nif they had been in a dream. I asked myself had these latter things\nindeed happened? I could not credit it.\nI rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge. My\nmind was blank wonder. My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their\nstrength. I dare say I staggered drunkenly. A head rose over the arch,\nand the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran\na little boy. He passed me, wishing me good night.

The\ninvigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians\nindisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their\nbodies.

The fever of war that would presently\nclog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to\ndevelop.\nAll night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,\nindefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and\never and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit\nsky.\nAbout eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed\nalong the edge of the common to form a cordon. Later a second company\nmarched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of the common.\nSeveral officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on the common\nearlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be missing.\nThe colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and was busy\nquestioning the crowd at midnight. The military authorities were\ncertainly alive to the seriousness of the business. About eleven, the\nnext morning’s papers were able to say, a squadron of hussars, two\nMaxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan regiment started\nfrom Aldershot.\nA few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road, Woking,\nsaw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It\nhad a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness like summer\nlightning. This was the second cylinder.\nIX.\nTHE FIGHTING BEGINS.\nSaturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense. It was a day of\nlassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating\nbarometer. I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in\nsleeping, and I rose early. I went into my garden before breakfast and\nstood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring but\na lark.",

The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely\nswept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European\nimmigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy\nas to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\nThe Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing\nsubtlety—their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of\nours—and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh\nperfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen\nthe gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century. Men like\nSchiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd, by-the-bye, that for\ncountless centuries Mars has been the star of war—but failed to\ninterpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so\nwell. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready.\nDuring the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated\npart of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of\nNice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in\nthe issue of _Nature_ dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this\nblaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk\ninto their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar\nmarkings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak\nduring the next two oppositions.\nThe storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached\nopposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange\npalpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of\nincandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of\nthe twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,\nindicated",

He told me that during\nthe night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns\nwere expected. Then—a familiar, reassuring note—I heard a train running\ntowards Woking.\n\n“They aren’t to be killed,” said the milkman, “if that can possibly be\navoided.”\nI saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then\nstrolled in to breakfast. It was a most unexceptional morning. My\nneighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to\ndestroy the Martians during the day.\n“It’s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,” he said. “It\nwould be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might\nlearn a thing or two.”\nHe came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for his\ngardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic. At the same time he\ntold me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links.\n“They say,” said he, “that there’s another of those blessed things\nfallen there—number two. But one’s enough, surely. This lot’ll cost the\ninsurance people a pretty penny before everything’s settled.” He\nlaughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this. The\nwoods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to\nme. “They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil\nof pine needles and turf,” he said, and then grew serious over “poor\nOgilvy.”\nAfter breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down towards the\ncommon. Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers—sappers, I\nthink, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and\nshowing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf.\nThey told me no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the\nroad towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men standing\nsentinel there.

They said that they did not know who had\nauthorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute\nhad arisen at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a great deal\nbetter educated than the common soldier, and they discussed the\npeculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness. I\ndescribed the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to argue among\nthemselves.\n“Crawl up under cover and rush ’em, say I,” said one.\n“Get aht!” said another. “What’s cover against this ’ere ’eat? Sticks\nto cook yer! What we got to do is to go as near as the ground’ll let\nus, and then drive a trench.”\n“Blow yer trenches! You always want trenches; you ought to ha’ been\nborn a rabbit Snippy.”\n“Ain’t they got any necks, then?” said a third, abruptly—a little,\ncontemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe.\nI repeated my description.\n“Octopuses,” said he, “that’s what I calls ’em. Talk about fishers of\nmen—fighters of fish it is this time!”\n“It ain’t no murder killing beasts like that,” said the first speaker.\n“Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish ’em?” said the\nlittle dark man. “You carn tell what they might do.”\n\n“Where’s your shells?” said the first speaker. “There ain’t no time. Do\nit in a rush, that’s my tip, and do it at once.”\nSo they discussed it. After a while I left them, and went on to the\nrailway station to get as many morning papers as I could.\nBut I will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning\nand of the longer afternoon. I did not succeed in getting a glimpse of\nthe common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the\nhands of the military authorities. The soldiers I addressed didn’t know\nanything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy.

About half past four I went up to the\nrailway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had\ncontained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,\nHenderson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was little I didn’t know.\nThe Martians did not show an inch of themselves. They seemed busy in\ntheir pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous\nstreamer of smoke. Apparently they were busy getting ready for a\nstruggle. “Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without\nsuccess,” was the stereotyped formula of the papers. A sapper told me\nit was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole. The\nMartians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the\nlowing of a cow.\nI must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation,\ngreatly excited me. My imagination became belligerent, and defeated the\ninvaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of\nbattle and heroism came back. It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at\nthat time. They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs.\nAbout three o’clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals\nfrom Chertsey or Addlestone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood\ninto which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the\nhope of destroying that object before it opened. It was only about\nfive, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the\nfirst body of Martians.\nAbout six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the\nsummerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon\nus, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately after\na gust of firing.

The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the\nroof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been\nat work upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it,\nflew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap\nof broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window.\nI and my wife stood amazed. Then I realised that the crest of Maybury\nHill must be within range of the Martians’ Heat-Ray now that the\ncollege was cleared out of the way.\nAt that I gripped my wife’s arm, and without ceremony ran her out into\nthe road. Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go\nupstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for.\n\n“We can’t possibly stay here,” I said; and as I spoke the firing\nreopened for a moment upon the common.\n“But where are we to go?” said my wife in terror.\nI thought perplexed. Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead.\n“Leatherhead!” I shouted above the sudden noise.\nShe looked away from me downhill. The people were coming out of their\nhouses, astonished.\n“How are we to get to Leatherhead?” she said.\nDown the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge;\nthree galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two\nothers dismounted, and began running from house to house. The sun,\nshining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees,\nseemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything.\n“Stop here,” said I; “you are safe here”; and I started off at once for\nthe Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart.

I was even afraid that that last\nfusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from\nMars.

A monstrous tripod, higher\nthan many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them\naside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now\nacross the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the\nclattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder.\nA flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in\nthe air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the\nnext flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool\ntilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression\n\nthose instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a\ngreat body of machinery on a tripod stand.\nThen suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted, as\nbrittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were\nsnapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared,\nrushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me. And I was galloping hard to\nmeet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether.\nNot stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse’s head hard round to\nthe right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the\nhorse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung sideways and fell\nheavily into a shallow pool of water.\nI crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in the\nwater, under a clump of furze. The horse lay motionless (his neck was\nbroken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk\nof the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still\nspinning slowly. In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding\nby me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford.\nSeen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere\ninsensate machine driving on its wa",

Ogilvy moved\nabout, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, one saw a\ncircle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field.\nIt seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly\nmarked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect\nround. But so little it was, so silvery warm—a pin’s head of light! It\nwas as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with\nthe activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view.\nAs I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to\nadvance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty\nmillions of miles it was from us—more than forty millions of miles of\nvoid.

It was\nvery dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming\ninfrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in\n\ncolumns through the gaps in the heavy foliage.\nIf I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I\nshould have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street\nCobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead. But that\nnight the strangeness of things about me, and my physical wretchedness,\nprevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin, deafened and\nblinded by the storm.\nI had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as much\nmotive as I had. I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch and\nbruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out into the\nlane that ran down from the College Arms. I say splashed, for the storm\nwater was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent. There in\nthe darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back.\nHe gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I could\ngather my wits sufficiently to speak to him.

I went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way\nalong its palings.\nNear the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of\nlightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of\nboots. Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the flicker\nof light had passed. I stood over him waiting for the next flash. When\nit came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily\ndressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay crumpled up close\nto the fence, as though he had been flung violently against it.\nOvercoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a\ndead bo",

Every now and then a haze of\nsmoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid\nthe Martian shapes. I could not see what they were doing, nor the clear\nform of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon.\nNeither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of it\ndanced on the wall and ceiling of the study.

As I did\nso, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the\nhouses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and\nblackened pine woods of Byfleet. There was a light down below the hill,\non the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along the\nMaybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins. The\nlight upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap and\na vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs. Then I\nperceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part smashed and on fire,\nthe hinder carriages still upon the rails.\nBetween these three main centres of light—the houses, the train, and\nthe burning county towards Chobham—stretched irregular patches of dark\ncountry, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and\nsmoking ground. It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set\nwith fire. It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries at\nnight.

They became pillars of\nbloodshot smoke at the first touch of day.\nXII.\nWHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON.\nAs the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had\nwatched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs.\nThe artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in.\nHe proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his\nbattery—No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan was to return at once\nto Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians\nimpressed me that I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and go\nwith her out of the country forthwith. For I already perceived clearly\nthat the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a\ndisastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed.\nBetween us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with its\nguarding giants. Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my\nchance and struck across country. But the artilleryman dissuaded me:\n“It’s no kindness to the right sort of wife,” he said, “to make her a\nwidow”; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the\nwoods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him.\nThence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead.\nI should have started at once, but my companion had been in active\nservice and he knew better than that. He made me ransack the house for\na flask, which he filled with whisky; and we lined every available\npocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat. Then we crept out\nof the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by\nwhich I had come overnight. The houses seemed deserted. In the road lay\na group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead by the\nHeat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped—a\nclock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables. At the\ncorner turning up towards the post office a little cart, filled with\nboxe",

A\ncash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris.\nExcept the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of the\nhouses had suffered very greatly here. The Heat-Ray had shaved the\nchimney tops and passed. Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem to be\na living soul on Maybury Hill. The majority of the inhabitants had\nescaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road—the road I had taken\nwhen I drove to Leatherhead—or they had hidden.\nWe went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now from\nthe overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill.\nWe pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul. The\n\nwoods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of\nwoods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain proportion\nstill stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage instead of\ngreen.\nOn our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it\nhad failed to secure its footing. In one place the woodmen had been at\nwork on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing,\nwith heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine. Hard by was\na temporary hut, deserted. There was not a breath of wind this morning,\nand everything was strangely still. Even the birds were hushed, and as\nwe hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked\nnow and again over our shoulders. Once or twice we stopped to listen.\nAfter a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the\nclatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers\nriding slowly towards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted while we\nhurried towards them. It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of\nthe 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman\ntold me was a heliograph.\n“You are the first men I’ve seen coming this way this morning,” said\nthe lieutenant. “What’s brewin",

Have been hiding. Trying to rejoin\nbattery, sir. You’ll come in sight of the Martians, I expect, about\nhalf a mile along this road.”\n“What the dickens are they like?” asked the lieutenant.\n“Giants in armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs and a body like\n’luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir.”\n“Get out!” said the lieutenant. “What confounded nonsense!”\n“You’ll see, sir. They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire and\nstrikes you dead.”\n“What d’ye mean—a gun?”\n“No, sir,” and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray.\nHalfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I\nwas still standing on the bank by the side of the road.\n“It’s perfectly true,” I said.\n“Well,” said the lieutenant, “I suppose it’s my business to see it too.\nLook here”—to the artilleryman—“we’re detailed here clearing people out\nof their houses. You’d better go along and report yourself to\nBrigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all you know. He’s at Weybridge.\nKnow the way?”\n“I do,” I said; and he turned his horse southward again.\n“Half a mile, you say?” said he.\n“At most,” I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward. He\nthanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more.\nFarther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in\nthe road, busy clearing out a labourer’s cottage. They had got hold of\n\na little hand truck, and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles\nand shabby furniture. They were all too assiduously engaged to talk to\nus as we passed.\nBy Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the\ncountry calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight. We were far\nbeyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for the\nsilent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement of\npacking in others, and the knot of soldiers standing",

The night was warm and I was thirsty,\nand I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the\ndarkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy\nexclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us.\nThat night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth\nfrom Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first\none. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with\npatches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a\nlight to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I\nhad seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till\none, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his\nhouse.

The gunners stood by the guns\nwaiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance.\nThe men stood almost as if under inspection.\n“That’s good!” said I. “They will get one fair shot, at any rate.”\nThe artilleryman hesitated at the gate.\n“I shall go on,” he said.\nFarther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number\nof men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more\nguns behind.\n“It’s bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,” said the\nartilleryman. “They ’aven’t seen that fire-beam yet.”\nThe officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the\ntreetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now and\nagain to stare in the same direction.\nByfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars, some\nof them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about. Three\nor four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an\nold omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village\nstreet. There were scores of people, most of them sufficiently\nsabbatical to have assumed their best clothes. The soldiers were having\nthe greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their\nposition. We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score\nor more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily expostulating with\nthe corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his\narm.\n“Do you know what’s over there?” I said, pointing at the pine tops that\nhid the Martians.\n“Eh?” said he, turning. “I was explainin’ these is vallyble.”\n“Death!” I shouted. “Death is coming!

The soldier had left him, and he was still standing by his\nbox, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely\nover the trees.\nNo one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were\nestablished; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen\nin any town before. Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing\nmiscellany of conveyances and horseflesh. The respectable inhabitants\nof the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed,\n\nwere packing, river-side loafers energetically helping, children\nexcited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this astonishing\nvariation of their Sunday experiences. In the midst of it all the\nworthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration, and his\nbell was jangling out above the excitement.\nI and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking fountain,\nmade a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us. Patrols of\nsoldiers—here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white—were warning\npeople to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the\nfiring began. We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing\ncrowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the\nswarming platform was piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary\ntraffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of the passage\nof troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savage\nstruggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at\na later hour.\nWe remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found\nourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames\njoin. Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little\ncart. The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are to be\nhired, and there was a ferry across the river.

People came\npanting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even\ncarrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of their\nhousehold goods piled thereon. One man told us he meant to try to get\naway from Shepperton station.\nThere was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting. The idea\npeople seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable\nhuman beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly\ndestroyed in the end. Every now and then people would glance nervously\nacross the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over\nthere was still.\nAcross the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was\nquiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side. The people who landed\nthere from the boats went tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat\nhad just made a journey. Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of\nthe inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to\nhelp. The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours.\n“What’s that?” cried a boatman, and “Shut up, you fool!” said a man\nnear me to a yelping dog. Then the sound came again, this time from the\ndirection of Chertsey, a muffled thud—the sound of a gun.\nThe fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across\nthe river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the\nchorus, firing heavily one after the other. A woman screamed. Everyone\nstood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible\nto us. Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding\nunconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless\nin the warm sunlight.\n“The sojers’ll stop ’em,” said a woman beside me, doubtfully.

That was it!\n“Get under water!” I shouted, unheeded.\nI faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian, rushed\nright down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water.

The noise was deafening.\nThen I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist.\nThey had passed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing,\ntumultuous ruins of their comrade.\n\nThe third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two\nhundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham. The generators of the\nHeat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way and\nthat.\nThe air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of\nnoises—the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses,\nthe thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling\nand roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with\nthe steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over\nWeybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that\ngave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses\nstill stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pallid in\nthe steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro.\nFor a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost boiling\nwater, dumbfounded at my position, hopeles",

Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth\nhas attempted to explain. It may be the gases of the firing caused the\nMartians inconvenience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through\na powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches,\nspread through the clearness of the planet’s atmosphere and obscured\nits more familiar features.\nEven the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular\nnotes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes\nupon Mars. The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember, made a happy\nuse of it in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those\nmissiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a\npace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by\nhour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost\nincredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men\ncould go about their petty concerns as they did.

I was\nalso very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no more water. It\nis a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for\nit, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me excessively.\nI do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably I\ndozed.

I dare say he\nfound me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my water-soaked\ntrousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders blackened by the\nsmoke. His face was a fair weakness, his chin retreated, and his hair\nlay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were\nrather large, pale blue, and blankly staring. He spoke abruptly,\nlooking vacantly away from me.\n“What does it mean?” he said. “What do these things mean?”\nI stared at him and made no answer.\nHe extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone.\n“Why are these things permitted?

He became alarmed at the news in\nthis, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if communication\nwere restored. The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and innumerable\npeople walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the\nstrange intelligence that the newsvendors were disseminating. People\nwere interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only on account of the local\nresidents. At the station he heard for the first time that the Windsor\nand Chertsey lines were now interrupted. The porters told him that\nseveral remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from\nByfleet and Chertsey stations, but that these had abruptly ceased. My\nbrother could get very little precise detail out of them.\n“There’s fighting going on about Weybridge” was the extent of their\ninformation.\nThe train service was now very much disorganised. Quite a number of\npeople who had been expecting friends from places on the South-Western\nnetwork were standing about the station. One g",

A man in a blue and\nwhite blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings.\n“There’s hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and\nthings, with boxes of valuables and all that,” he said. “They come from\nMolesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there’s been guns heard\nat Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have told them to\nget off at once because the Martians are coming. We heard guns firing\nat Hampton Court station, but we thought it was thunder. What the\ndickens does it all mean? The Martians can’t get out of their pit, can\nthey?”\nMy brother could not tell him.\nAfterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the\nclients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday excursionists\nbegan to return from all over the South-Western “lung”—Barnes,\nWimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth—at unnaturally early hours;\nbut not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of.\nEveryone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered.\nAbout five o’clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely\nexcited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almost\ninvariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western\nstations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and\ncarriages crammed with soldiers. These were the guns that were brought\nup from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston. There was an exchange\nof pleasantries: “You’ll get eaten!” “We’re the beast-tamers!” and so\nforth. A little while after that a squad of police came into the\nstation and began to clear the public off the platforms, and my brother\nwent out into the street again.\nThe church bells were ringing for evens",

There was talk of a floating body. One\nof the men there, a reservist he said he was, told my brother he had\nseen the heliograph flickering in the west.\nIn Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had\njust been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and\nstaring placards. “Dreadful catastrophe!” they bawled one to the other\ndown Wellington Street. “Fighting at Weybridge! Full description!\nRepulse of the Martians! London in Danger!” He had to give threepence\nfor a copy of that paper.\nThen it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full\npower and terror of these monsters. He learned that they were not\nmerely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds\nswaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and\nsmite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand\nagainst them.\nThey were described as “vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred feet\nhigh, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot out a\nbeam of intense heat.” Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns, had\nbeen planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially\n\nbetween the Woking district and London. Five of the machines had been\nseen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been\ndestroyed. In the other cases the shells had missed, and the batteries\nhad been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays. Heavy losses of soldiers\nwere mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic.\nThe Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable. They had\nretreated to their t",

At all the street corners groups of people were reading\npapers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors.\nThey seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the roads, my\nbrother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day.

There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the\npeople went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the\nsound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into\nmelody by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the\nred, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the\nsky.

It was seen early in the\nmorning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the\natmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary\nfalling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it\nthat glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on\nmeteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about\nninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth\nabout one hundred miles east of him.\nI was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my\nFrench windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved\n\nin those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet\nthis strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space\nmust have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only\nlooked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its flight say it\ntravelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many\npeople in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of\nit, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No\none seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night.\nBut very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting\nstar and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common\nbetween Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of\nfinding it.

The Martian who had been\noverthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small brown figure,\noddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight, and\napparently engaged in the repair of his support. About nine he had\nfinished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees again.\nIt was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels\nwere joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick black tube. A\nsimilar tube was handed to each of the three, and the seven proceeded\nto distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between\nSt. George’s Hill, Weybridge, and the village of Send, southwest of\nRipley.\nA dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they\nbegan to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher.\nAt the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly armed with\ntubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western\nsky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and\npainfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford. They\nmoved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist covered the\nfields and rose to a third of their height.\nAt this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began\nrunning; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I turned\naside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad\nditch by the side of the road. He looked back, saw what I was doing,\nand turned to join me.\nThe two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the\nremoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away\ntowards Staines.\nThe occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their\npositions in the huge crescent about their c",

The\nsignal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and\nvanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a\ntense expectation. The Martians had but to advance into the line of\nfire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns\nglittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a\nthunderous fury of battle.\nNo doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant\nminds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle—how much they\nunderstood of us. Did they grasp that we in our millions were\norganized, disciplined, working together? Or did they interpret our\nspurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady\ninvestment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of\nonslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? Did they dream they might\nexterminate us? (At that time no one knew what food they needed.) A\nhundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that\nvast sentinel shape. And in the back of my mind was the sense of all\nthe huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward. Had they prepared\npitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare?

Another nearer, and then another. And then the Martian beside us\nraised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report\nthat made the ground heave. The one towards Staines answered him. There\nwas no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation.\nI was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that\nI so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber\nup into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I did so a second\nreport followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards\nHounslow. I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such\nevidence of its work. But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with\none solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath.\nAnd there had been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence was\nrestored; the minute lengthened to three.\n“What has happened?” said the curate, standing up beside me.\n“Heaven knows!” said I.\nA bat flickered by and vanished. A distant tumult of shouting began and\nceased. I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now moving\neastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion.\nEvery moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon\nhim; but the evening calm was unbroken. The figure of the Martian grew\nsmaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering night\nhad swallowed him up. By a common impulse we clambered higher. Towards\nSunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had suddenly\ncome into being there, hiding our view of the farther country; and\nthen, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw another such\nsummit. These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared.\nMoved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a\nthird of these cloudy black kopjes had risen.\nEverything had suddenly become very stil",

But\n\nthe earthly artillery made no reply.\nNow at the time we could not understand these things, but later I was\nto learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the\ntwilight. Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have\ndescribed, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a\nhuge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other\npossible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him. Some fired only\none of these, some two—as in the case of the one we had seen; the one\nat Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time.\nThese canisters smashed on striking the ground—they did not explode—and\nincontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour,\ncoiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous\nhill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country.\nAnd the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was\ndeath to all that breathes.\nIt was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,\nafter the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank\ndown through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather\nliquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the\nvalleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the\ncarbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do. And\nwhere it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface\nwould be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and\nmade way for more. The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a\nstrange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one could\ndrink without hurt the water from which it had been strained. The\nvapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do. It hung together in\nbanks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the lan",

For a day and a half he remained there, weary,\nstarving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the\nprospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs,\ngreen trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns,\nouthouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight.\nBut that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to\nremain until it sank of its own accord into the ground. As a rule the\nMartians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it again\nby wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it.\nThis they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight\nfrom the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had\nreturned. From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and\nKingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled,\nand we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in\nposition there.

Before the guns on the Richmond and\nKingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in\nthe southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the\nblack vapour could overwhelm the gunners.\nSo, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps’\nnest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the\nLondonward country. The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart, until\nat last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden. All night\nthrough their destructive tubes advanced. Never once, after the Martian\nat St. George’s Hill was brought down, did they give the artillery the\nghost of a chance against them. Wherever there was a possibility of\nguns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of the black vapour\nwas discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray\nwas brought to bear.\nBy midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and the\nglare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke,\nblotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the\neye could reach. And through this two Martians slowly waded, and turned\ntheir hissing steam jets this way and that.\nThey were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they had\nbut a limited supply of material for its production or because they did\nnot wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the\nopposition they had aroused. In the latter aim they certainly\nsucceeded. Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to\ntheir movements. After that no body of men would stand against them, so\nhopeless was the enterprise.

One of the men desisted and turned towards him,\nand my brother, realising from his antagonist’s face that a fight was\nunavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and\nsent him down against the wheel of the chaise.\nIt was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet\nwith a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the\nslender lady’s arm. He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung\nacross his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and\nthe man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the\ndirection from which he had come.\nPartly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the\nhorse’s head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the\nlane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking back.\nThe man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him\nwith a blow in the face. Then, realising that he was deserted, he\ndodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise, with the\nsturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now,\nfollowing remotely.\nSuddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and\nhe rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again.\nHe would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady\nvery pluckily pulled up and returned to his help. It seems she had had\na revolver all this time, but it had been under the seat when she and\nher companion were attacked. She fired at six yards’ distance, narrowly\nmissing my brother. The less courageous of the robbers made off, and\nhis companion followed him, cursing his cowardice. They both stopped in\nsight down the lane, where the third man lay inse",

When my brother looked\nagain they were retreating.\n\n“I’ll sit here,” said my brother, “if I may”; and he got upon the empty\nfront seat. The lady looked over her shoulder.\n“Give me the reins,” she said, and laid the whip along the pony’s side.\nIn another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my\nbrother’s eyes.\nSo, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a cut\nmouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an\nunknown lane with these two women.\nHe learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon\nliving at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous\ncase at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the\nMartian advance. He had hurried home, roused the women—their servant\nhad left them two days before—packed some provisions, put his revolver\nunder the seat—luckily for my brother—and told them to drive on to\nEdgware, with the idea of getting a train there. He stopped behind to\ntell the neighbours. He would overtake them, he said, at about half\npast four in the morning, and now it was nearly nine and they had seen\nnothing of him. They could not stop in Edgware because of the growing\ntraffic through the place, and so they had come into this side lane.\nThat was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently\nthey stopped again, nearer to New Barnet. He promised to stay with\nthem, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the\nmissing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with the\nrevolver—a weapon strange to him—in order to give them confidence.\nThey made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became\nhapp",

The sun crept higher\nin the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an\nuneasy state of anticipation. Several wayfarers came along the lane,\nand of these my brother gathered such news as he could. Every broken\nanswer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had\ncome on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity\nfor prosecuting this flight. He urged the matter upon them.\n“We have money,” said the slender woman, and hesitated.\nHer eyes met my brother’s, and her hesitation ended.\n“So have I,” said my brother.\nShe explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold, besides a\nfive-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get upon a\ntrain at St. Albans or New Barnet. My brother thought that was\nhopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,\nand broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and\nthence escaping from the country altogether.\nMrs. Elphinstone—that was the name of the woman in white—would listen\nto no reasoning, and kept calling upon “George”; but her sister-in-law\nwas astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last agreed to my\nbrother’s suggestion. So, designing to cross the Great North Road, they\nwent on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony to save it as much\nas possible. As the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively\nhot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew burning and blinding, so\nthat they travelled only very slowly. The hedges were grey with dust.\nAnd as they advanced towards Barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew\nstronger.\n\nThey began to meet more people. For the most part these were staring\nbefore them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard, unclean.\nOne man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on the ground.\nThey heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw one hand clutched\nin his hair and ",

Then round the corner of the lane, from\nbetween the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high\nroad, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a\nsallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust. There were three girls,\nEast End factory girls, and a couple of little children crowded in the\ncart.\n“This’ll tike us rahnd Edgware?” asked the driver, wild-eyed,\nwhite-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the\nleft, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks.\nMy brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in\nfront of them, and veiling the white façade of a terrace beyond the\nroad that appeared between the backs of the villas. Mrs. Elphinstone\nsuddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up\nabove the houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky. The\ntumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of\nmany voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking of waggons, and the\nstaccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the\ncrossroads.\n“Good heavens!” cried Mrs. Elphinstone. “What is this you are driving\nus into?”\nMy brother stopped.\nFor the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent of human\nbeings rushing northward, one pressing on another. A great bank of\ndust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything\nwithin twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was\nperpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and\nof men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every",

Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy bundle and\nweeping. A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue, circled dubiously\nround them, scared and wretched, and fled at my brother’s threat.\nSo much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses to\nthe right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent in\nbetween the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded forms,\ngrew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner, hurried past,\nand merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was\nswallowed up at last in a cloud of dust.\n\n“Go on! Go on!” cried the voices. “Way! Way!”\nOne man’s hands pressed on the back of another. My brother stood at the\npony’s head. Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace by pace,\ndown the lane.\nEdgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but\nthis was a whole population in movement. It is hard to imagine that\nhost. It had no character of its own. The figures poured out past the\ncorner, and receded with their backs to the group in the lane. Along\nthe margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels,\nstumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another.\nThe carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making little\nway for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward\nevery now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so,\nsending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the\nvillas.\n“Push on!” was the cry. “Push on!

Some of the\npeople who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and\nquarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at nothing\nwith miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or lay\nprostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances. The horses’ bits were\ncovered with foam, their eyes bloodshot.\nThere were cabs, carriages, shop-carts, waggons, beyond counting; a\nmail cart, a road-cleaner’s cart marked “Vestry of St. Pancras,” a huge\ntimber waggon crowded with roughs. A brewer’s dray rumbled by with its\ntwo near wheels splashed with fresh blood.\n“Clear the way!” cried the voices. “Clear the way!”\n“Eter-nity! Eter-nity!” came echoing down the road.\nThere were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with children\nthat cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their\nweary faces smeared with tears. With many of these came men, sometimes\nhelpful, sometimes lowering and savage. Fighting side by side with them\npushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed,\nloud-voiced, and foul-mouthed. There were sturdy workmen thrusting\ntheir way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like clerks or shopmen,\nstruggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed, men\ndressed in the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature in a\nnightshirt with a coat thrown over it.\nBut varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had in\ncommon. There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind them.\nA tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent the whole\nhost of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken\nthat his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed\nactivity.

It was such a gradual movement that\nhe discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been\nnear him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the\ncircumference. Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,\nuntil he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk\nforward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash.

The lane opened slantingly\ninto the main road with a narrow opening, and had a delusive appearance\nof coming from the direction of London. Yet a kind of eddy of people\ndrove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the\nmost part rested but a moment before plunging into it again. A little\nway down the lane, with two friends bending over him, lay a man with a\nbare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags. He was a lucky man to have\nfriends.\nA little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black\nfrock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his\nboot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble, and hobbled on\nagain; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw\nherself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping.\n“I can’t go on!

They rolled hither and\nthither among the struggling feet of men and horses. The man stopped\nand looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab struck his\nshoulder and sent him reeling.

A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter\nfrom the chaise. In another moment they were caught and swept forward\nby the stream. My brother, with the cabman’s whip marks red across his\nface and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her.\n“Point the revolver at the man behind,” he said, giving it to her, “if\nhe presses us too hard. No!—point it at his horse.”\n\nThen he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across\nthe road. But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition, to become\na part of that dusty rout. They swept through Chipping Barnet with the\ntorrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before\nthey had fought across to the opposite side of the way. It was din and\nconfusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks\nrepeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the stress.\nThey struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of the\nroad, and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude\nof people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at the water.\nAnd farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw two trains\nrunning slowly one after the other without signal or order—trains\nswarming with people, with men even among the coals behind the\nengines—going northward along the Great Northern Railway. My brother\nsupposes they must have filled outside London, for at that time the\nfurious terror of the people had rendered the central termini\nimpossible.\nNear this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the\nviolence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them.\nThey began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and\nnone of them dared to sleep. And in the evening many people came\nhurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fl",

Not only along the road through Barnet, but\nalso through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward to\nSouthend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames to Deal and\nBroadstairs, poured the same frantic rout. If one could have hung that\nJune morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above London every\nnorthward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets\nwould have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives, each dot\na human agony of terror and physical distress. I have set forth at\nlength in the last chapter my brother’s account of the road through\nChipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how that swarming\nof black dots appeared to one of those concerned. Never before in the\nhistory of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered\ntogether. The legendary hosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia\nhas ever seen, would have been but a drop in that current. And this was\nno disciplined march; it was a stampede—a stampede gigantic and\nterrible—without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed\nand unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout\nof civilisation, of the massacre of mankind.\nDirectly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of\nstreets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,\ngardens—already derelict—spread out like a huge map, and in the\nsouthward _blotted_. Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would have\nseemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart. Steadily,\nincessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out\nramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising\nground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a",

They do not seem to\nhave aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and\nthe destruction of any opposition. They exploded any stores of powder\nthey came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked the railways here and\nthere. They were hamstringing mankind. They seemed in no hurry to\nextend the field of their operations, and did not come beyond the\ncentral part of London all that day. It is possible that a very\nconsiderable number of people in London stuck to their houses through\nMonday morning. Certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the\nBlack Smoke.\nUntil about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene.\nSteamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous\nsums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many who swam\nout to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned. About\none o’clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the\nblack vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge. At that\nthe Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting, and collision, and\nfor some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern\narch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and lightermen had to fight\nsavagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront.\nPeople were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from\nabove.\nWhen, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and\nwaded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse.\nOf the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell. The\nsixth star fell at Wimbledon. My br",

On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across\nthe sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester.\nThe news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of\nLondon was confirmed. They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it was\nsaid, at Neasden. But they did not come into my brother’s view until\nthe morrow.\nThat day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of\nprovisions. As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be\nregarded. Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and\nripening root crops with arms in their hands. A number of people now,\nlike my brother, had their faces eastward, and there were some\ndesperate souls even going back towards London to get food. These were\nchiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge of the Black\nSmoke came by hearsay. He heard that about half the members of the\ngovernment had gathered at Birmingham, and that enormous quantities of\nhigh explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines\nacross the Midland counties.\nHe was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the\ndesertions of the first day’s panic, had resumed traffic, and was\nrunning northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of\nthe home counties. There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar\nannouncing that large stores of flour were available in the northern\ntowns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed\namong the starving people in the neighbourhood. But this intelligence\ndid not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three\npressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution\n\nthan this promise. Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear more\nof it. That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose Hill. It\nfell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that duty\n",

She saw it.\nOn Wednesday the three fugitives—they had passed the night in a field\nof unripe wheat—reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the\ninhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the\npony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the\npromise of a share in it the next day. Here there were rumours of\nMartians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey Powder\nMills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders.\nPeople were watching for Martians here from the church towers. My\nbrother, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at\nonce to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of them\nwere very hungry. By midday they passed through Tillingham, which,\nstrangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save for a\nfew furtive plunderers hunting for food. Near Tillingham they suddenly\ncame in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all\nsorts that it is possible to imagine.\nFor after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came on\nto the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and afterwards\nto Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people. They lay in a huge\nsickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze.\nClose inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks—English, Scotch,\nFrench, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches from the Thames, yachts,\nelectric boats; and beyond were ships of larger burden, a multitude of\nfilthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats,\npetroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport even, neat white\nand grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue coast\nacross the Blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of\nboats chaffering with the people on the beach, a swarm which also\nextended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon.\nAbout a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,\nalmost, to my brother’s per",

It was the only warship in sight, but far away\nto the right over the smooth surface of the sea—for that day there was\na dead calm—lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of\nthe Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line, steam up and\nready for action, across the Thames estuary during the course of the\nMartian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it.\nAt the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the assurances\nof her sister-in-law, gave way to panic. She had never been out of\nEngland before, she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a\nforeign country, and so forth. She seemed, poor woman, to imagine that\nthe French and the Martians might prove very similar. She had been\ngrowing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed during the two\ndays’ journeyings. Her great idea was to return to Stanmore. Things had\nbeen always well and safe at Stanmore. They would find George at\nStanmore....\nIt was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the\nbeach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention\nof some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames. They sent a boat and\ndrove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three. The steamer was\ngoing, these men said, to Ostend.\nIt was about two o’clock when my brother, having paid their fares at\nthe gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his\ncharges. There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the\n\nthree of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward.\nThere were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of whom\nhad expended their last money in securing a passage, but the captain\nlay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up\npassengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded. He\nwould probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of\nguns that began about that hour in the south. As if in ",

At the\nsame time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three\nironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of\nblack smoke. But my brother’s attention speedily reverted to the\ndistant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising\nout of the distant grey haze.\nThe little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big\ncrescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and\nhazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance,\nadvancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness. At that\nthe captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and\nanger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his\nterror. Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the\nsteamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or\nchurch towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human\nstride.\nIt was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed\nthan terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the\nshipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell\naway. Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over\nsome stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading\ndeeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between\nsea and sky. They were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the\nescape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness\nand the Naze.
